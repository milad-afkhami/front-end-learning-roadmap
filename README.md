# Front-end Learning Roadmap

This is(I.M.O.) the roadmap to become a senior front-end developer.

I may have dropped some tools somewhere so feel free to mention missing items in [issues section](https://github.com/milad-afkhami/front-end-learning-roadmap/issues).

## Priorities

The dashed borders surrounding the subtopics are indicating that what is gonna be the order of grouped concepts in your learning path.

- <span style="color:#FF3C00;">Red</span> Border: topics with a high priority
- <span style="color:#F3D321;">Yellow</span> Border: topics with a normal priority, start these concepts after finishing all the topics with high priority.
- <span style="color:#05A8F4;">Blue</span> Border: topics with a low priority, start these concepts after finishing all the topics with high & normal priority.
